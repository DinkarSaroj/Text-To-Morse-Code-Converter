# Text to Morse Code Converter

A simple web application built using **Flask** to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. You can enter plain text, convert it to Morse code, or input Morse code to get the corresponding text.

## Features
- **Text to Morse Code**: Converts any text input to its Morse code equivalent.
- **Morse Code to Text**: Converts any Morse code input to the corresponding text.
- **Download the Result**: Save the conversion result as a `.txt` file.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the frontend of the application.
- **JavaScript**: For some interactive elements on the page.
- **Morse Code Algorithm**: Python functions to handle conversion between text and Morse code.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Text-to-Morse-Code-Converter.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Text-to-Morse-Code-Converter
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash

    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
